This was originally called "Waves" but I changed the name to "Destructo." Sounds cooler.

The game is pretty lame right now. I kind of want to put in a public high score table. I might do that later.

At any rate you can view the game on the market here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grendel.waves&hl=en
